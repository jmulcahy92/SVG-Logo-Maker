# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

Generates an SVG logo from user inputs, utilizing Node.js's File System module, Inquirer.js, template literals, and classes.

## Installation

This project depends on the Node.js File System module, so you will need to install that. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs). You will also need to install Inquirer.js (version 8.2.4). To do so, open your terminal in the "main" folder of this project and input the command `npm install inquirer@8.2.4`

## Usage

To use this SVG Logo Maker, follow these instructions (as demonstrated in the video linked below). <br>
    1. Open your terminal in the "main" folder of this project and and input the command `node index.js` <br>
    2. Answer the prompts, picking up to three characters to fill the text portion of your logo, a shape (square, circle, or triangle), and colors for both the text and the shape.<br>
After answering all the prompts, your new SVG logo will be saved to "logo.svg"
